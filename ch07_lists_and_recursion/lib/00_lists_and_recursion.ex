# I defined our sum function to carry a partial total as a second parameter so I could illustrate how
# to use accumulators to build values. The sum function can also be written without an accumulator. 
# Can you do it?

defmodule MyList00 do
  def sum([]), do: 0
  def sum([head | tail]) do
    head + sum(tail)
  end
